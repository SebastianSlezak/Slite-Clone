# Slite Clone Website Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Slite clone website, detailing the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. The website emulates Slite's core features, focusing on knowledge management and team collaboration.

## Project Structure

The project is comprised of three main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the entire HTML markup for the website.
- `styles.css`: Defines the visual appearance using CSS.
- `app.js`: Handles dynamic behavior on the website.

### index.html

This file structures the website into several key sections:

- **Header**: Contains the navigation bar with logo, navigation links, and interactive buttons for user actions.
- **Main Content**: Houses the main features, benefits, and interactive sections like forms and calls to action.
- **Footer**: Includes additional navigation, contact info, social links, legal info, and a newsletter signup.

#### Key Elements

- `header`: Sticky header that changes style on scroll.
- `main`: Main body of the page, featuring product info, testimonials, pricing plans, etc.
- `footer`: Footer containing supplementary links and information.

### styles.css

The stylesheet file `styles.css` manages the layout, colors, fonts, and other aesthetic aspects of the website.

#### Features

- **Fonts**: Utilizes the 'Inter' font family for a clean and modern look.
- **Colors and Themes**: Employs a consistent color scheme across the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site is accessible and functional across various devices.

### app.js

The JavaScript file adds interactive features:

- **Dynamic Header**: Adjusts the header's size based on the user's scroll position for better navigation and visibility.

## Features

1. **Responsive Navigation**: Navigation adapts based on user interaction and page position.
2. **Interactive Elements**: Visual feedback on hover and click for buttons and links.
3. **Dynamic Behavior**: The header resizes on page scroll to focus user attention on content.

## Usage

To deploy the project, upload all files to your hosting server or repository, including necessary images and assets referenced within the HTML and CSS.

## Collaboration

Contributors should fork the repository and create feature or bug fix branches. Pull requests are used for merging changes after code review.

## Versioning

Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for clear and organized version management. Update versions with significant changes, feature additions, or bug fixes.
